# tictactoe

## Description
This is my fourth project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. In this prompt response, I have built a website that will enable two users to play Tic Tac Toe together within the browser, using HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Jumping off of the Library project I completed earlier, this project helped me practice new skills in modules and factory functions, such as placing variables in functions, private variables and functions, and in the import/export methods for using multiple scripts at once. I did a lot of research to form and develop my solution response to this prompt.

I chose, as I have in previous projects and will continue to do in future projects, to style this project using both previously learned and new CSS skills. New skills implemented in this project include using self-hosted fonts, greater specificity in box-shadow declarations and rgba values, animations using the transition property, and more rgba values to enable opacity/transparency.
