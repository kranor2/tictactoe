Jose Carlos Latorre
===================

This file provides detailed information on the Jose Carlos Latorre Font.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Jose Carlos Latorre font was born out of the idea to immortalize my own
handwriting. Since I have memory my teachers and everyone told me that
my handwriting was terrible so I decided to put it in a True Type Font
for future generations and so that they can annoy their professors as 
well.
